****Divide and Conquer Approach****

Experiment 1 - Maximum sub Array Problem, possible unordered pair in an array of 4 algorithm, finding largest element in an array algorithm<br>
Experiment 2 - Implement the iterative and recursive Binary search and compare their performance.<br>
Experiment 3 - Implement divide and conquer based merge sort and quick sort algorithms and compare their performance for the same set of elements.<br>
Experiment 4 - Compare the performance of Strassen method of matrix multiplication with traditional way of matrix multiplication.
#
**Greedy & Dynamic Programming Approach**

Experiment 1 - Implement the activity selection problem to get a clear understanding of greedy approach.
