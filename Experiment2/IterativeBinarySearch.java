Time Complexity:
The time complexity of an iterative binary search is O(log n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

Explanation:
In each iteration, the search space (the portion of the array being considered) is halved.
This halving process continues until the search space becomes empty or the target value is found.
Since the number of elements in the search space is reduced by half with each step, the total number of iterations required is proportional to the logarithm of n to the base 2, i.e., logâ‚‚(n).
Thus, the time complexity is O(log n).

Space Complexity:
The space complexity of the iterative binary search is O(1).

Explanation:
The algorithm only uses a few additional variables like low, high, mid, and target.
These variables occupy constant space regardless of the size of the input array.
No additional data structures are used that grow with the input size.
Thus, the space complexity is O(1), or constant space.

Summary:
Time Complexity: O(log n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
